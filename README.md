HIL Testing using DSpace and Virtual validations. 
To validate all possible combinations of various Body control module. Features Software used for this project is Control Desk, HIL system. Developed test plans for different possible conditions during different ignition, voltage and operational conditions. Working in a project Virtual validation where my responsibilities are under to check SIM-LIN and TCI-CAN communication in MATLAB models. Converting the physical HVAC subsystem to a Virtualized one through the GT model, Simulink model, and to operate the model through the GM-SIM controller which is of virtualized.

LOD ECU
The LOD ECU monitors the health status of circuits connected with trailer lamps and the information is sent to Telematic ECU over CAN. The LOD ECU monitors 5 circuits – BLACK, YELLOW, RED, BROWN & GREEN, which in turn branches to multiple lamps through SAE J560 electrical box, Diagnostic stack, Linear scheduler and Boot loader.

MBM ECU
The Memory Bolster Module (MBM) is designed for Omega Plux Seat. MBM software should perform two basic operations in the form of Lumbar adjustment, and Massaging. The software is designed in layered base. The algorithm and stacks used to design the application LIN slave stack, Diagnostic stack, Linear scheduler and Boot loader.

RAM disk booting for Beagle bone black
To use the initrd functionality, the bootloader gets involved on most architectures to pass the initrd image to the kernel. A common scenario is that the bootloader loads a compressed kernel image into memory and then loads an initrd image into another section of available memory. In doing so, it becomes the bootloader’s responsibility to pass the load address of the initrd image to the kernel before passing control to it. The exact mechanism differs depending on the architecture, bootloader, and platform implementation.
